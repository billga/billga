## Fallacies of Distraction

<ul>

<li><b>False Dilemma</b>: two choices are given when in fact there are three options

<li><b>From Ignorance</b>: because something is not known to be true, it is assumed to be false

<li><b>Slippery Slope</b>: a series of increasingly unacceptable consequences is drawn

<li><b>Complex Question</b>: two unrelated points are conjoined as a single proposition

</ul>

## Appeals to Motives in Place of Support

<ul>

<li><b>Appeal to Force</b>: the reader is persuaded to agree by force

<li><b>Appeal to Pity</b>: the reader is persuaded to agree by sympathy

<li><b>Consequences</b>: the reader is warned of unacceptable consequences

<li><b>Prejudicial Language</b>: value or moral goodness is attached to believing the author

<li><b>Popularity</b>: a proposition is argued to be true because it is widely held to be true (argumentum ad populum)

</ul>

## Changing the Subject

<ul>

<li><b>Attacking the Person</b>:

<ol>

<li>the person's character is attacked

<li>the person's circumstances are noted

<li>the person does not practise what is preached

</ol>

<li><b>Appeal to Authority</b>: <i>argumentum ad verecundiam</i>

<ol>

<li>the authority is not an expert in the field

<li>experts in the field disagree

<li>the authority was joking, drunk, or in some other way not being serious

</ol>

<li><b>Anonymous Authority</b>: the authority in question is not named

<li><b>Style Over Substance</b>: the manner in which an argument (or arguer) is presented is felt to affect the truth of the conclusion

</ul>

## Inductive Fallacies

<ul>

<li><b>Hasty Generalization</b>: the sample is too small to support an inductive generalization about a population

<li><b>Unrepresentative Sample</b>: the sample is unrepresentative of the sample as a whole

<li><b>False Analogy</b>: the two objects or events being compared are relevantly dissimilar

<li><b>Slothful Induction</b>: the conclusion of a strong inductive argument is denied despite the evidence to the contrary

<li><b>Fallacy of Exclusion</b>: evidence which would change the outcome of an inductive argument is excluded from consideration

</ul>

## Fallacies Involving Statistical Syllogisms

<ul>

<li><b>Accident</b>: a generalization is applied when circumstances suggest that there should be an exception

<li><b>Converse Accident </b>: an exception is applied in circumstances where a generalization should apply

</ul>

## Causal Fallacies

<ul>

<li><b>Post Hoc</b>: because one thing follows another, it is held to cause the other

<li><b>Joint effect</b>: one thing is held to cause another when in fact they are both the joint effects of an underlying cause

<li><b>Insignificant</b>: one thing is held to cause another, and it does, but it is insignificant compared to other causes of the effect

<li><b> Wrong Direction</b>: the direction between cause and effect is reversed

<li><b>Complex Cause</b>: the cause identified is only a part of the entire cause of the effect

</ul>

## Missing the Point

<ul>

<li><b>Begging the Question</b>: the truth of the conclusion is assumed by the premises ("When did you stop beating your wife?")

<li><b>Irrelevant Conclusion</b>: an argument in defense of one conclusion instead proves a different conclusion

<li><b>Straw Man</b>: the author attacks an argument different from (and weaker than) the opposition's best argument

</ul>

## Fallacies of Ambiguity

<ul>

<li><b>Equivocation</b>: the same term is used with two different meanings

<li><b>Amphiboly</b>: the structure of a sentence allows two different interpretations

<li><b>Accent</b>: the emphasis on a word or phrase suggests a meaning contrary to what the sentence actually says

</ul>

## Category Errors

<ul>

<li><b>Composition</b>: because the attributes of the parts of a whole have a certain property, it is argued that the whole has that property

<li><b>Division</b>: because the whole has a certain property, it is argued that the parts have that property

</ul>

## Non Sequiteur

<ul>

<li><b>Affirming the Consequent</b>: any argument of the form: If A then B, B, therefore A

<li><b>Denying the Antecedent</b>: any argument of the form: If A then B, Not A, thus Not B

<li><b>Inconsistency</b>: asserting that contrary or contradictory statements are both true

</ul>

## Syllogistic Errors

<ul>

<li><b>Fallacy of Four Terms</b>: a syllogism has four terms

<li><b>Undistributed Middle</b>: two separate categories are said to be connected because they share a common property

<li><b>Illicit Major</b>: the predicate of the conclusion talks about all of something, but the premises only mention some cases of the term in the predicate

<li><b>Illicit Minor</b>: the subject of the conclusion talks about all of something, but the premises only mention some cases of the term in the subject

<li><b>Fallacy of Exclusive Premises</b>: a syllogism has two negative premises

<li><b>Fallacy of Drawing an Affirmative Conclusion From a Negative Premise</b>: as the name implies

<li><b>Existential Fallacy</b>: a particular conclusion is drawn from universal premises

</ul>

## Fallacies of Explanation

<ul>

<li><b>Subverted Support</h2> (The phenomenon being explained doesn't exist)

<li><b>Non-support</h2> (Evidence for the phenomenon being explained is biased)

<li><b>Untestability</h2> (The theory which explains cannot be tested)

<li><b>Limited Scope</h2> (The theory which explains can only explain one thing)

<li><b>Limited Depth</h2> (The theory which explains does not appeal to underlying causes)

</ul>

## Fallacies of Definition

<ul>

<li><b>Too Broad</h2> (The definition includes items which should not be included)

<li><b>Too Narrow</h2> (The definition does not include all the items which shouls be included)

<li><b>Failure to Elucidate</h2> (The definition is more difficult to understand than the word or concept being defined)

<li><b>Circular Definition</h2> (The definition includes the term being defined as a part of the definition)

<li><b>Conflicting Conditions</h2> (The definition is self-contradictory)

</ul>


Appeal to Tradition: "we never did it that way before"

Argumentum ad Ignoratium: cannot prove it false, so it must be true; misdirection; half-truths

Ad Hominem: against the man; personal attacks

Appeal to emotion: cf. clubbing baby seals
